 *
 * `useCopilotChatSuggestions` integrates auto-generated chat suggestions into your application in the context of your
 * app's state. It dynamically manages suggestions based on provided configurations and
 * dependencies.
 *
 * <RequestExample>
 *   ```jsx useCopilotChatSuggestions Example
 *   import { useCopilotChatSuggestions }
 *     from "@copilotkit/react-ui";
 *
 *   useCopilotChatSuggestions({
 *     instructions: "Your instructions for suggestions.",
 *   })
 *   ```
 * </RequestExample>
 *
 * ## Basic Setup
 *
 * To incorporate this hook into your React components, start by importing it:
 *
 * ```tsx
 * import { useCopilotChatSuggestions } from "@copilotkit/react-ui";
 * ```
 *
 * Then, use it in your component to initiate suggestion functionality:
 *
 * ```tsx
 * useCopilotChatSuggestions({
 *   instructions: "Your instructions for suggestions.",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Dependency Management
 *
 * ```tsx
 * import { useCopilotChatSuggestions } from "@copilotkit/react-ui";
 *
 * useCopilotChatSuggestions(
 *   {
 *     instructions: "Suggest the most relevant next actions.",
 *   },
 *   [appState],
 * );
 * ```
 *
 * In the example above, the suggestions are generated based on the given instructions.
 * The hook monitors `appState`, and updates suggestions accordingly whenever it changes.
 *
 * ## Behavior and Lifecycle
 *
 * The hook registers the configuration with the chat context upon component mount and
 * removes it on unmount, ensuring a clean and efficient lifecycle management.
